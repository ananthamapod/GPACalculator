# GPA Calculator Built with React

Essentially this repository was something I made a couple of months ago to learn how React works. Well now, I'm all grown up and have used React several times, but I figured I'd make it anyway to get some practice in. Then as I started building it out more, I realized I haven't learned as much about React in the meantime as I thought I did. So long story short, this is the end product of relearning React after learning it wrong on the fly. Enjoy!
